# cafe-management-system-c-program
This project is a simple Cafe Management System built in C that allows an administrator to:

View the cafe's menu,

Add, remove, or update items,

Take customer orders,

Track item stock and calculate bills.

The program demonstrates the use of structures, arrays, string handling, menu-driven logic, and admin login authentication.
